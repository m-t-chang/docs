description: 'Collecting your authorization credentials to access the API'

Before you can access our API, you will need two pieces of identifying information: your bearer token, and your Workspace (Organization) ID.

## Bearer token

The bearer token is a cryptic string that authenticates you, the user, and authorizes you to use our services. In order to obtain a bearer token, you must first sign up for a Petal account, and then log in. 

Once you have logged in, please follow these steps to obtain your token:
1. Open the developer tool in your browser.
2. Go to the Network tab. You should find a list of recent requests there. If there are none, refresh the Petal app page.
3. Click on one of the requests. Under the `Request Headers` section, you should find an entry named `Authorization`, with a value of `Bearer <string>`. If there is no such entry, try another request.
4. Copy the `<string>` part of the header, without `Bearer`. This is your bearer token.

The image below should resemble what you see in your developer tool.

## Workspace (Organization) ID

Since every Petal user can create a number of Workspaces (also called Organizations in our API), you will need to find the ID of the particular Workspace you wish to work with. To do this, log in to your Petal account, and follow the steps below.
1. Open the developer tool in your browser, and go to the Network tab.
1. Navigate to the Workspace settings page of your desired Workspace by clicking the button at the bottom of the left-hand menu.

2. In your developer tool, there should appear a request: `GET
	https://cite.petal.org/api/payment/subscription_info?organization_id=<id>`, where `<id>` is an integer. This is your Workspace ID.

The image below depicts what you can expect to find in your developer tool.

Once you have both pieces of information, you are all set to begin to use our API!
